Comparative daily analysis of the message that the TVE broadcast compared to the most relevant messages on Twitter about an event, specifically, about the covid-19 confinement in Spain.
In order to extract the message transmitted by the TVE news, the data will be taken from the Verba web API, which shows the daily news transcription from noon and night. The program will analyse those phrases that talks about the confinement.

In the case of Twitter, the relevant profiles will first be searched by centrality metrics according to the number of daily retweets, then only those messages will be analyzed.

In both cases, the messages will be analyzed at the sentiment and morphological level, and later will compare them in a visualization accessible to all.

The objective is to detect the possible differences of the generated messages in both environments, based on the hypothesis that Twitter, as a 2.0 environment, allows the creation and dissemination of content without a rigid and vertical editorial line, typical of the media of the pre-internet era, thus being able to provide relevant profiles that would hardly fit in a conventional communication media.
